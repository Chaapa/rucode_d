his is the solution to the problem from the Rucode Festival 2023. In this task, it was necessary to place accents in words.

This solution showed accuracy 92, but it could have been better, since there was a limit on the complexity of the model, we wrote a formula by which we estimated the complexity of the forest of decision trees and made a mistake in it. 

The approximate accuracy should have been 95 if the model parameters were slightly corrected.
